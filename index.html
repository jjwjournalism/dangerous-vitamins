			Centrum Silver for Women is the leading stated cause of supplement choking incidents reported to the FDA, according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm494015.htm">Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition’s Adverse Event Reporting System</a> (CAERS) database.
		</p>

		<p>
			The database collects reports of harmful side effects associated with foods, beverages, supplements, and cosmetics. It combines mandatory submissions from manufacturers with voluntary submissions from consumers and healthcare practitioners. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The popular women’s multivitamin is listed as the suspected cause for at least 797 choking incidents during the collection period, which goes from late 2003 through March of 2017. That’s nearly three and a half times the frequency of the second-most-reported choking hazard, Centrum Silver for Adults, which has 225 reported choking incidents during the same period. It also accounts for more than 25 percent of all non-concomitant choking events—that is, events in which one substance is to blame. Centrum products, including some that have been discontinued, are well-represented in the top 10, which also includes One A Day, Citracal, and Caltrate products.

		<p>
			There are a number of possible reasons for Centrum Silver for Women’s spot at the top. The simplest and most obvious is that it’s just a very popular multivitamin. Centrum Silver (subtype unspecified) was the bestselling non-private label multivitamin brand in 2016, with $181.3 million in multi-outlet sales, according to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/195561/leading-us-vitamin-brands-based-on-sales/">Drugstore News report from last year</a>. But is its representation in the CAERS proportional to its market share? Without sales data for the top 10 from the whole collection period, it’s difficult to know.

		</p>

		<p>
			Another possible reason is the large size of the vitamin tablet, and the challenge it could pose for its target demographic of women 50 and older. Tablet size information is difficult to find online, but the product’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Centrum-Multivitamin-Multimineral-Supplement-Vitamin/product-reviews/B0000VLXUA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_4?filterByKeyword=large&search-alias=community-reviews&pageNumber=4#reviews-filter-bar">Amazon reviews</a> suggest that at least some consumers find the pill difficult to swallow. The CAERS records suggest it, too: in addition to choking, Centrum Silver for Women is associated with symptoms like dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, and throat irritation.

		</p>

		<p>
			Still, they shouldn’t pose a problem for older adults in good health, according to Abraham Brody, the associate director of the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing at New York University. 

		</p>

		<p>
			“Normal older adults don’t have swallowing difficulties,” he said. But, he added, there are plenty of conditions that could lead to swallowing difficulties, like stroke or certain forms of dementia.

		</p>

		<p>
			Unfortunately, the CAERS records don’t include individuals’ health information or diagnoses beyond those connected with the reported product. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Which brings us to a third and final possible reason for Centrum Silver for Women’s dominance: the fundamental incompleteness of the data. As noted in the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/UCM494019.pdf">README document</a> associated with the CAERS database, adverse effect records are published exactly as reported by consumers, healthcare practitioners, and manufacturers. They don’t represent a confirmation by the FDA that the listed supplement did in fact cause the adverse effect. The records are also far from complete. Many lack age and adverse event date information, and some product names have been redacted. Finally, the product names themselves were not kept consistent across records, making the data incredibly difficult to analyze. Centrum Silver Ultra Women’s, for instance, had over 60 different spellings in the dataset, ranging from the understandable “Centrum Silver Ultra Womens” to the mind-bending “Centurm Silver (Multiminerals, Multivitamins) Tablet.”

		<p>
			Yes, Centurm.

			The takeaway? Don’t ditch your multivitamins just yet—at least until adverse event reporters get a better grip on spellcheck.
